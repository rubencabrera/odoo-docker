# Compose file suitable for local development.
# Run with:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
# Will start a container with odoo and another one with postgres exposed
# on port 5433 (in case you have a local postgres already running).
# Also mounts a volume in your machine's /opt/odooo-docker/opt path mounted
# where the container's code is. The projects are cloned there, so you can
# use git to manage each container's repo branches.
